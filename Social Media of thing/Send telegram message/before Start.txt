Code
The code can be basically divided into three major parts. They are,

Reading values from the Bolt device
Comparing the sensor value with the threshold.
Sending a message via Telegram if the threshold has been breached.
The above steps are put in a while loop so that it reads the sensor value every 10 seconds and sends the alert if required.

We will be building the system functionally as,

Reading the sensor value from the device.
Sending a Telegram message.
Checking if sensor value is valid and sending a message if it exceeds the threshold.
How this works
Telegram is a third-party messaging service which is similar to WhatsApp. It is free of cost and simple to use.

Telegram has a feature called as Bots which are just customized applications which you can build in order to send messages to a particular channel or group.

So, if we want to send a message to a channel, we will need to send a request to Telegram instructing the bot to send a message to a particular group.
