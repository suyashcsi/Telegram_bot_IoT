# Telegram_bot_IoT
Bots are third-party applications that run inside Telegram. Users can interact with bots by sending them messages, commands and requests.  
We will be using Bots to send alerts on our channel.


What will we learn in this project?
In this project, I will be able to send alerts via Telegram to your phone when the sensor value exceeds your set threshold.
